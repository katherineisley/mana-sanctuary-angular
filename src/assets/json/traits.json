    "trait": "Benediction Resonance: Increase Max HP by 10% for the entire team. This effect cannot be stacked. Additionally, increase your Max HP by 10%. Each time you successfully use the skill while having hyperbody or more than 50% HP, grant hyperbody to all allies for  seconds.",
    "notes": "Best trait for benediction overall. Grants extra HP to allies and hyperbody, which is very useful in difficult fights. Not being pushed or stunned is a great damage increase for the party."

    "trait": "When you use a support weapon, increase healing and healing received by 20%. And when you use a support-type weapon's discharge skill or weapon skill, increase nearby allies' ATK by 15% for 5 seconds.",
    "notes": "Good if you donâ€™t have Lyra or if you act as secondary healer in the party. If no hyperbody is needed, this trait is better than Lyra."
