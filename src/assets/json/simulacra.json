This is why you wouldn’t be spending much time on her weapon during battle. Her passives provide amazing utility for the whole team and this is what makes her an amazing healer. For a list of her passives, check below. Most of the improvements in her stars are connected to her Guards. You will receive 1 Guard for every 15% HP you heal. For support, she is great at 0★ and she gains more passives at 3, 5 and 6★.",
